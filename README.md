# Data-Science-Projects

Project Description:
MonPG, a leading provider of loan services, is keen on expanding its Top-up loan offerings to its existing customer base. To achieve this goal, they have enlisted our expertise as Analytics Engineers to develop a predictive model that identifies potential customers likely to avail of Top-up loan services in the future. Furthermore, MonPG is looking to harness real-time data streams to enhance their service recommendations using Apache Kafka and Apache Spark Streaming.

Project Objectives:

Develop a predictive machine learning model to identify potential Top-up loan customers among the existing client base.
Train the model using historical static data to make accurate predictions.
Implement data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training as part of this phase (Part A).
Integrate the machine learning model into the streaming platform, enabling real-time data processing for personalized recommendations (Part B).
Enhance MonPG's ability to proactively recommend loan services to customers based on their behavior and needs.
Key Deliverables (Part A):

Data preprocessing pipeline for static customer data.
Machine learning model(s) for predicting potential Top-up loan customers.
Model evaluation metrics and performance analysis.
Technologies Used (Part A):

Python for data preprocessing and model development.
Popular machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
Jupyter Notebooks for prototyping and documentation.
Project Phases:

Part A: Static Data Analysis and Model Training

Data collection and preprocessing.
Feature selection and engineering.
Machine learning model development.
Model evaluation and fine-tuning.
Part B: Real-time Recommendation Engine (Future Phase)

Integration of machine learning models with Apache Kafka and Apache Spark Streaming.
Real-time data processing for dynamic recommendations.
Continuous monitoring and model updates.
Project Impact:
This project aims to significantly increase MonPG's revenue by targeting the right customers with Top-up loan services. Additionally, the integration of real-time recommendation capabilities will enhance customer engagement and satisfaction.
